        <p>The world has now been digitalized. It has revolutionized every infrastructure. We no longer need to stand in
          a queue for hours for banking transactions. In rural areas, we can complete many works even in the house. It
          saves our time as well as our efforts. Digitalization, a boon from technology has made our life easier in
          many ways.

        <p>Everything has been digitalized with the advance use of technology which is good in a way but has also some
          negative impacts. The rise of digital media has increased security concerns. There's a high possibility of
          cybercrime and threats in recent age. There are some cons of technology. It has increased competition between
          companies which results in the increment of unemployment and more poverty. People are suffering from
          addiction and are mostly jobless due to the excessive use of technology.
